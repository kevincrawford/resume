			<p>The world has a fascination with glass. And why not? It’s feels organic, it’s transparent, it allows us to confine and restrict while giving the appearance of being open. So when you look around a real world touch interfaces, glass is always involved as the first substrate that interacts with your finger, but why not maintain glass throughout the whole experience? Why add LCD panels, aluminum bezels, and the ever so boring TV Frame that you see almost everywhere? It’s because our imagination of what touch screens should be has not been equally matched with today’s modern technology.</p>
			<p>Tony Stark rids himself of TV looking touch screens as he builds “Iron Man.” He practically manipulates digital objects in the air, grabbing, throwing, spinning, and creating using full human gestures. And modern day kids as well as “hard to impress” adults will perfectly jaw drop when they see our version of “Iron Man.” For the old school folks, they maybe more familiar with “Minority Report” featuring Tom Cruise.</p>
			<p>They say this floating touch interfaces is for Hollywood films. We say B#$@#S. It’s here and it’s beyond awesome. And we know how to create it, build it, configure it, install it, and blow people’s minds, guaranteed.</p>
			<p>Typically only our best Las Vegas customers can afford to do this, and heck, even the famous Hugh Hefner had us install the Ghost Wall just 5 feet away from the infamous Grotto at the Playboy Mansion. The Ghost Wall is for the cool kids of marketing and Nervana wants you to have it asap.</p>

			<p>The MixBoard was developed out of challenge to build the best Bulletin Board to replace the paper and thumb tack methodology of tacking paper flyers to a board to inform students and people of the events and happenings that are occurring throughout the campus using a chaotic pattern of paper overlapping each other and using the traditional means of putting stamps on a flyer to indicate expiration and using the ever so plentiful student intern to walk the full campus to take the expired flyers down.</p>
			<p>The idea of using the Bulletin Board for marketing student events and activities have extended to using chalk to write on the sidewalks and roads as well as going so far as to “taping” the flyers to the sidewalks causing a literal paper mess on campus upon the first rainfall.</p>
			<p>This earth damaging process is implemented by our intelligent universities, our intelligent students, and intelligent staff members because they have “no other choice.”</p>
			<p>So we were determined to create not only an intelligent option and choice, but to make this one of the best technologies we’ve ever created.  As a result, we were nominated by the Chicago Innovation Awards as one of the best innovations of the year.</p>
			<p>In developing our MixBoard, we knew something was missing.  We knew that the user, the student, the staff person, the visitor was not going to live in front of the MixBoard, so how do we solve allowing them to take the board with them?  Mobile?  Of course.  But not your average run of the mill mobile app that everyone is building.  We wanted the same beautiful experience on a large 60 inch touchscreen to have the same fun experience on a 4 inch screen.  And after several weeks of development, we knocked it out of the park.</p>

			<p>Traditional restaurant menus reinvented as integrated interactive POS devices that go far beyond just “ordering food.” Nervana’s iPad Social&nbsp;Menu collects real-time data from a restaurant guest such as personal likes, dislikes and food and drink pairing preferences and has the ability to dynamically change to meet an individual’s ordering needs. Nervana’s iPad Social&nbsp;Menu will deliver the richest social and digital content to support the menu with high resolution images, multiple views, videos, and real-time recommendations while also offering a “customer feedback” loop.</p>
			<p>Nervana’s iPad Image Menu will bring all the services of social mediums such as Yelp, Facebook and Four Square to the customer’s finger tips to assist with buying decisions and even offers the restaurant owner the opportunity to intercept and influence the customer’s decision making process right at the point of sale. This level of interactive dining experience is redefining the restaurant industry.</p>
